        <section class="intro">
            <p class="intro-text">
                Y2Q explores how security systems survive long enough for their underlying assumptions to fail. It is a research project concerned with long-horizon risk, systemic failure, hidden dependencies, and time-based degradation—not with tools, trends, or quick fixes.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Y2Q studies uncertainty, survivability, and failure modes. It examines what breaks, why it breaks, and how failure cascades through interconnected systems. The research spans three domains: the core concept of Y2Q itself, the long-term implications of quantum computing on cryptographic assumptions, and the systemic risks embedded in complex software supply chains.

            <h2>Core Research Themes</h2>
            <div class="themes-grid">
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Time as a Security Threat</h3>
                    <p>Security systems degrade over time. Cryptographic assumptions age. Dependencies rot. What protects today may expose tomorrow. Time is a threat that traditional security thinking does not adequately address.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Assumption Failure</h3>
                    <p>Every system encodes assumptions about threats, capabilities, hardware, and time. When assumptions fail—and they do—systems fail. We study which assumptions are most fragile and why.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Systemic & Cascading Failure</h3>
                    <p>Failures do not occur in isolation. Dependencies create chains of collapse. A single weak point can trigger cascades that bring down systems across an entire supply chain or infrastructure layer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Visibility Gaps and Hidden Dependencies</h3>
                    <p>We cannot see all components, all dependencies, or all risks. Blind spots exist by design, accident, and complexity. What we cannot see, we cannot defend.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</h3>
                    <p>Perfect information is impossible. Threat models are always incomplete. We study how to decide, build, and survive without full knowledge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="theme-card">
                    <h3>Survivability Over Prevention</h3>
                    <p>Prevention alone is insufficient. Systems must be designed to survive failure, not just prevent it. Survivability means resilience, recovery, and adaptation over time.</p>

                Y2Q research spans three interconnected domains. Each examines a different aspect of how security systems fail over time.

                    <p>Explores how quantum computing challenges cryptographic assumptions built into systems deployed today. Focuses on long-horizon risk, harvest-now-decrypt-later threats, and the responsibility of securing long-lived data.</p>

                    <p>Examines how component dependencies, supply chains, and hidden relationships create systemic risk. Focuses on visibility, trust relationships, and how failures propagate through interconnected systems.</p>
