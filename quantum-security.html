                <h4>Integer Factorisation in Polynomial Time  RSA Is Broken</h4>
                <p>RSA security rests on the computational hardness of factoring large integers. Classically, factoring a 2048-bit number would take longer than the age of the universe. Shor's algorithm (1994) factors the same number in polynomial time on a quantum computer. There is no RSA key length that provides quantum resistance  RSA-4096 is as broken as RSA-1024.</p>

                <p>Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH, P-256, P-384, Curve25519, secp256k1) relies on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Shor's algorithm also solves this in polynomial time. All ECC is broken. This affects HTTPS, TLS 1.3 key exchange, SSH, code signing, Bitcoin, and every system using elliptic-curve primitives.</p>

    <h2>The Problem Space</h2>
    <p>Quantum computing is not simply "faster cryptography breaking." It is a fundamental shift in computational capability that renders certain mathematical problems  and the entire security architecture built upon them  invalid. Systems designed with the assumption that large integer factorisation is computationally infeasible face a direct, documented change in their threat model.</p>
    <p>The question is not whether cryptographically relevant quantum computers will exist. IBM's roadmap, documented error-correction advances, and sustained national-scale investment make the trajectory clear. The question is the planning horizon  and for data with multi-year confidentiality requirements, that planning horizon is already past.</p>
    <div class="uncertainty-note"><strong>Y2Q Assessment:</strong> The 2035 NIST deprecation deadline is not the risk threshold  it is the regulatory final deadline. High-risk systems protecting long-lived sensitive data face harvest-now-decrypt-later exposure today. The effective migration deadline for those systems is now.</div>
</article>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>The NIST Post-Quantum Standards</h2>
    <p>NIST completed its seven-year post-quantum cryptography standardisation process in August 2024. The published standards are:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)</strong>  Key encapsulation mechanism replacing RSA and ECDH. Based on the Module-LWE hardness problem. Three parameter sets for different security levels. This is the primary algorithm for quantum-safe key exchange in TLS and other protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)</strong>  Digital signature algorithm replacing RSA-PSS and ECDSA. Based on Module-LWE and Module-SIS. Deterministic signing, fast verification. This is the primary algorithm for quantum-safe digital signatures.</li>
        <li><strong>FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)</strong>  Stateless hash-based signature algorithm. Security based only on hash function properties  entirely independent of lattice assumptions. Larger signatures, more conservative security basis. Recommended as a hedge alongside ML-DSA.</li>
        <li><strong>FN-DSA (FIPS 206, in progress)</strong>  NTRU lattice-based signature algorithm (FALCON). Compact signatures suitable for constrained environments. Standardisation ongoing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NIST guidance: begin deploying ML-KEM for key exchange immediately. Plan ML-DSA and SLH-DSA migration for signing applications. NSA CNSA 2.0 sets specific timelines for National Security System migration.</p>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later: Why the Threat Is Present</h2>
    <p>The most important and most misunderstood aspect of quantum security is the harvest-now-decrypt-later threat vector. It changes the threat model in a fundamental way:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>The collection does not require quantum capability</strong>  Adversaries need only the ability to intercept and store encrypted traffic, which they already have</li>
        <li><strong>Long-lived sensitive data is the primary target</strong>  State secrets, intellectual property, legal and financial records, diplomatic communications, and medical data with multi-decade sensitivity</li>
        <li><strong>The attack is retroactive</strong>  Data encrypted years or decades ago becomes decryptable when quantum hardware arrives. There is no patching of historical communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Nation-state actors have the infrastructure and patience</strong>  NSA and CISA have explicitly characterised HNDL as an active collection strategy by state-sponsored adversaries</li>
        <li><strong>The effective breach has already occurred for high-risk data</strong>  If this data was transmitted using classical cryptography and could have been intercepted, it should be treated as potentially compromised against a future quantum-capable adversary</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>Migration Uncertainty and the Crypto-Agility Imperative</h2>
    <p>Post-quantum cryptography carries its own uncertainties that responsible analysis must acknowledge:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Unproven at enterprise scale</strong>  Post-quantum algorithms have not been deployed at the scale of RSA/ECC; implementation vulnerabilities remain possible</li>
        <li><strong>Potential future cryptanalysis</strong>  Mathematical techniques could weaken lattice-based algorithms; this is why multiple distinct algorithm families (lattice, hash-based) have been standardised</li>
        <li><strong>Performance and protocol impact</strong>  ML-KEM ciphertexts and ML-DSA signatures are larger than classical equivalents; protocol-level changes and performance testing are required</li>
        <li><strong>Transition period exposure</strong>  During hybrid classical/PQC deployment, systems must handle both; hybrid key exchange mitigates exposure during this window</li>
        <li><strong>Migration complexity at scale</strong>  Enterprise cryptographic migration requires a complete C-BOM as the starting inventory; without it, migration is ungoverned and incomplete</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="uncertainty-note"><strong>Crypto-Agility:</strong> Design cryptographic systems so algorithms can be replaced without architectural redesign. The quantum transition will not be the last forced migration. Systems built for crypto-agility today will be far less costly to maintain across future cryptographic transitions.</div>
