            <strong>Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later Attacks Are Active Right Now</strong>
            <p>State-sponsored actors are intercepting and storing encrypted network traffic today — targeting data with long-term confidentiality value. When a cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists, this data decrypts instantly. Without a Cryptographic Bill of Materials, you cannot identify which of your systems are affected.</p>

<!-- ── WHAT IS C-BOM ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>What Is a Cryptographic Bill of Materials?</h2>
    <p>
        A Cryptographic Bill of Materials (C-BOM) is a comprehensive, structured inventory of every cryptographic algorithm, protocol, key, certificate, library, and cipher suite deployed across an organisation's systems. It answers the questions that attackers — and quantum computers — are already asking: What cryptographic assumptions protect your data? What is the weakest link? What breaks first?
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike a standard software bill of materials (SBOM), a C-BOM focuses specifically on the cryptographic foundations of security — the layer that quantum computing directly attacks. A C-BOM maps not just what algorithms are deployed, but their age, their quantum vulnerability, their data protection scope, and when they require migration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core insight is stark: <strong>you cannot manage what you cannot measure.</strong> Without a complete cryptographic inventory, organisations have no baseline from which to plan post-quantum migration, no visibility into where harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks have the highest value, and no understanding of their cryptographic technical debt.
    </p>
    <div class="uncertainty-note">
        <strong>The Y2Q Position:</strong> A C-BOM is not a one-time compliance exercise. It is a living asset that becomes increasingly critical as the quantum timeline compresses. Organisations that do not begin now will face emergency migration — the worst possible context for getting cryptography right.

                <p>Peter Shor's 1994 algorithm proves that a quantum computer can factorise large integers in polynomial time, directly breaking RSA public-key encryption. It can also solve the discrete logarithm problem, breaking elliptic-curve cryptography. This mathematical fact has been documented for 30 years. The attack is not theoretical — only the hardware is pending.</p>

                <p>State-sponsored threat actors are actively harvesting encrypted communications today, storing ciphertext for decryption when quantum capability arrives.

Data encrypted with RSA or ECC today has zero long-term confidentiality against a quantum-capable adversary.</p>

<!-- ── WHAT GOES INTO A C-BOM ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>What Goes Into a Complete C-BOM?</h2>
    <p>A complete C-BOM documents every cryptographic component across the full stack:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Symmetric algorithms</strong> — AES (128/192/256), ChaCha20, DES (legacy), 3DES, RC4; mode of operation (GCM, CBC, CTR)</li>
        <li><strong>Asymmetric algorithms</strong> — RSA (all key sizes), ECDSA, ECDH, DH; key length, curve name, usage purpose</li>
        <li><strong>Hash functions</strong> — SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-3, MD5 (legacy), SHA-1 (deprecated); where each is used and why</li>
        <li><strong>Key derivation functions</strong> — PBKDF2, Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt; iteration counts and salt management</li>
        <li><strong>Protocols and cipher suites</strong> — TLS versions and configured cipher suites, SSH algorithm negotiation, VPN configurations</li>
        <li><strong>Certificates</strong> — X.509 certificate inventory, expiration dates, signing algorithms, certificate authority chains</li>
        <li><strong>Key management infrastructure</strong> — Generation, storage (HSM, software, cloud KMS), rotation schedules, retirement procedures</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptographic libraries</strong> — OpenSSL, BoringSSL, NSS, libsodium, Bouncy Castle; versions and known CVEs</li>
        <li><strong>Post-quantum migration status</strong> — Which components are migrated, in planning, or unaddressed</li>
        <li><strong>Data classifications and lifetimes</strong> — What data each algorithm protects and for how long confidentiality is required</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<!-- ── CRYPTO AGILITY ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>Crypto-Agility: The Architecture Requirement</h2>
    <p>
        A C-BOM is not useful if the systems it inventories cannot be changed. Crypto-agility — the ability to swap cryptographic algorithms without redesigning entire systems — is the architectural property that makes a C-BOM actionable.
    </p>
    <p>Crypto-agility requires:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Algorithm abstraction</strong> — Cryptographic operations are encapsulated behind interfaces; implementations are swappable without touching application logic</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel protocol support</strong> — New algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA) can be deployed alongside legacy ones during transition windows</li>
        <li><strong>Migration planning</strong> — Defined processes for deprecating old algorithms and adopting new ones on documented timelines</li>
        <li><strong>Performance impact assessment</strong> — Post-quantum algorithms have different performance characteristics; latency and throughput must be re-evaluated</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid key exchange</strong> — Combining classical and post-quantum algorithms during transition ensures protection against both attack classes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Without crypto-agility, discovery via C-BOM produces a list of problems with no path to resolution. NIST's Migration to Post-Quantum Project at the NCCoE specifically prioritises identifying and fixing crypto-rigid systems before the 2035 deadline.
    </p>

<!-- ── QUANTUM RISK AND C-BOM ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>C-BOM and the Quantum Risk Intersection</h2>
    <p>
        The quantum risk in a C-BOM inventory is not uniform. Prioritisation depends on the intersection of algorithm vulnerability and data lifetime:
    </p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Long-lifetime sensitive data + quantum-vulnerable algorithm = Critical</strong> — State secrets, medical records, legal documents, intellectual property. These are harvest targets today. Replace encryption immediately or accept that eventual exposure is certain.</li>
        <li><strong>Short-lifetime data + quantum-vulnerable algorithm = Medium</strong> — Transient session data, ephemeral tokens. The confidentiality window may close before quantum computers are available — but this depends on timelines that are accelerating.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-lifetime data + quantum-safe algorithm = Low</strong> — If you have already migrated to AES-256, ML-KEM, or ML-DSA, the long-term risk is substantially reduced.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital signatures + quantum-vulnerable algorithm = High</strong> — Signatures validated in the future (legal documents, software updates, certificates) lose integrity if the signing algorithm is quantum-broken. Non-repudiation and authenticity fail.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="uncertainty-note">
        <strong>The Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later Problem:</strong> For confidentiality, the threat exists NOW. Adversaries do not need quantum computers to collect data — only to store it. Your C-BOM must identify data with multi-year confidentiality requirements and flag it for immediate encryption upgrade, regardless of when quantum computers actually arrive.
    </div>

<!-- ── C-BOM AS COMPLIANCE TOOL ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>C-BOM as Compliance and Governance Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>C-BOM is increasingly required by or directly referenced in regulatory frameworks:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>NIST IR 8547 and PQC Migration</strong> — Explicitly recommends cryptographic inventory as the foundation of post-quantum migration planning. Without a C-BOM, compliance with the 2035 deadline is not achievable in a structured way.</li>
        <li><strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)</strong> — The IDENTIFY function requires asset inventory including cryptographic assets.</li>
        <li><strong>PCI-DSS v4.0</strong> — Requires documented cryptographic protocols for payment card data protection and management of cryptographic key lifecycles.</li>
        <li><strong>HIPAA</strong> — Mandates encryption standards for protected health information, requiring knowledge of what algorithms are deployed.</li>
        <li><strong>EU Cyber Resilience Act</strong> — Emerging requirements around software and hardware cybersecurity will increasingly drive C-BOM-style inventories.</li>

<!-- ── LIVING DOCUMENT ── -->
<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>C-BOM as a Living System</h2>
    <p>
        A C-BOM that is not continuously maintained becomes a liability. Systems change. Dependencies are updated. New CVEs are published. Quantum timelines compress. An outdated C-BOM creates false confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Maintaining a living C-BOM requires:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li>Integration with development and deployment pipelines — cryptographic changes trigger automatic C-BOM updates</li>
        <li>Automated discovery tooling — scanners that identify cryptographic usage across codebases, configurations, and network traffic</li>
        <li>Regular review cycles — at minimum quarterly; more frequently for high-risk environments</li>
        <li>Change ownership — defined accountability for each cryptographic component and its migration status</li>
        <li>Incident trigger integration — cryptographic vulnerability disclosures automatically cross-referenced with the inventory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Y2Q C-BOM Tool provides the version control, audit logging, and automated assessment infrastructure required to keep a C-BOM alive and actionable across organisational time horizons.
    </p>
    <div class="uncertainty-note">
        <strong>Honest Note:</strong> A C-BOM is not a solution to quantum risk. It is a prerequisite for developing one. Without knowing what you have, you cannot plan what to change. The tool makes the inventory manageable — the migration decisions remain yours.
