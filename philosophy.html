    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <p>Y2Q is built on foundational beliefs about security, systems, and failure that shape everything we research and every tool we build:</p>
    <ul class="philosophy-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Assumptions are attack surfaces.</strong> Every system encodes assumptions. Those assumptions can fail. When they do, systems fail. Security is not about preventing all failures  it is about understanding which assumptions are most fragile, most consequential, and closest to expiring. RSA's assumption that factoring is computationally hard is expiring on a documented timeline.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security fails systemically, not individually.</strong> A single vulnerable algorithm is manageable. The problem emerges when algorithm vulnerabilities, dependency chains, migration complexity, and organisational inertia combine. Cryptographic systems fail as interconnected architectures, not as isolated components. The C-BOM maps that architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Time amplifies risk.</strong> What is computationally secure today becomes insecure when computational capability changes. Harvest-now-decrypt-later means the risk of today's encryption failure lands in the future  but the collection is happening now. Security must be designed with the knowledge that its mathematical foundations have expiration dates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Survivability matters more than prevention alone.</strong> Perfect prevention is impossible. The quantum threat cannot be prevented  it can only be prepared for. Cryptographic migration, crypto-agile architecture, and a complete C-BOM inventory are survivability tools, not prevention tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Visibility precedes control.</strong> You cannot defend what you cannot see. You cannot migrate what you have not inventoried. The C-BOM Tool exists because visibility over the cryptographic attack surface is the prerequisite for every subsequent quantum security decision.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tools must match the honest assessment.</strong> Y2Q does not produce research and leave organisations without a path to act on it. The C-BOM Tool operationalises the core insight directly: inventory, assess, prioritise, migrate. Research that produces only conclusions without tools serves the researcher, not the problem.
        </li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="philosophy-article reveal">
    <h2>Why Y2Q Builds Real Products</h2>
    <p>The quantum threat is not a research hypothesis. It is documented, timestamped, and active:</p>
    <ul class="philosophy-list">
        <li>Shor's algorithm has been published for 30 years. The mathematical proof is settled.</li>
        <li>NIST published finalised post-quantum standards in August 2024. Migration targets exist.</li>
        <li>State-sponsored actors are running harvest-now-decrypt-later collection operations today.</li>
        <li>IBM has a funded, precisely documented roadmap to quantum advantage by 2026.</li>
        <li>NIST has set a 2035 deprecation deadline for all quantum-vulnerable algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Research that identifies a documented risk and stops at publication is incomplete. Y2Q builds the C-BOM Tool because organisations need more than awareness  they need the capability to act. The tool provides cryptographic inventory, quantum vulnerability assessment, compliance checking, and migration prioritisation in a single professional platform.</p>
    <p>The tool reflects Y2Q principles: no false confidence in the risk scores, complete visibility over the cryptographic surface, actionable output aligned to NIST guidance, and version-controlled living inventory that stays accurate as systems change.</p>

    <h2>What Y2Q Refuses to Do</h2>
    <ul class="refuses-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Use marketing language that obscures rather than informs.</strong> We do not use words like "innovative," "cutting-edge," "next-generation," or "transformative." These words describe emotional responses to products, not the products themselves. We describe what the tool does and what the risk is.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Claim authority we do not have.</strong> We do not claim to have solved the quantum problem. We claim to provide the cryptographic inventory and assessment methodology that is the prerequisite for managing it. These are precise and different claims. The difference matters.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prioritise solution selling over problem understanding.</strong> Most "quantum-safe security solutions" are incomplete answers wrapped in comprehensive marketing. Understanding the full problem  algorithm distribution, data lifetime mapping, migration sequencing, cryptographic dependency chains  is what makes any solution effective.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use fear disproportionate to the evidence.</strong> The quantum threat is serious enough on the documented facts. HNDL attacks are active. NIST standards are published. IBM roadmaps are precise. Fear beyond the evidence distorts decision-making. Clear, cited risk analysis produces better outcomes than dread.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pretend we have certainty we do not possess.</strong> We do not know exactly when cryptographically relevant quantum computers will be broadly accessible. We do not know how much data has been harvested. We are honest about these uncertainties. We simply do not allow uncertainty to become a justification for inaction when the documented evidence supports action now.
        </li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="philosophy-article reveal">
    <h2>Why Prevention-Only Security Strategies Fail</h2>
    <p>Most enterprise security programs are structured primarily around prevention: stronger firewalls, aggressive patching, better encryption, compliance certification. Prevention is necessary  but it is not sufficient:</p>
    <ul class="philosophy-reasons">
        <li>
            <strong>You cannot prevent harvest-now-decrypt-later.</strong> The collection is happening whether or not you strengthen your current encryption. The response is to eliminate the future value of current ciphertext by migrating to post-quantum algorithms  not to prevent collection that is already in progress.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You cannot prevent cryptographic assumption failure through patching.</strong> RSA is not vulnerable because of a software flaw. It is vulnerable because the mathematical problem underlying it will become quantum-tractable. This is not a CVE. It cannot be patched. It requires migration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You cannot prevent complexity from widening your attack surface.</strong> Every dependency you add, every cryptographic library you upgrade, every system you deploy adds to the cryptographic attack surface. Without a C-BOM, that surface grows invisibly. Prevention requires visibility first.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You cannot prevent organisational knowledge loss.</strong> The engineers who chose your current cryptographic algorithms may have left. The documentation may be incomplete. The dependencies may be undocumented. The C-BOM is how you reconstruct that knowledge before it becomes critical.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Survivability  designing systems to function despite failure, to migrate when assumptions expire, and to recover when compromise occurs  is the framework that fills the gaps prevention leaves open.</p>
</article>

<article class="philosophy-article reveal">
    <h2>Survivability as the Right Framework for Quantum Risk</h2>
    <p>For the quantum transition specifically, survivability means:</p>
    <ul class="philosophy-reasons">
        <li><strong>Inventory before migration.</strong> You cannot migrate what you have not inventoried. A C-BOM is the first survivability step  without exception.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritise by actual risk, not theoretical risk.</strong> Data with long-term confidentiality requirements faces HNDL exposure today. Systems managing that data should migrate first  independent of the 2035 regulatory deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>Build for crypto-agility.</strong> Design cryptographic systems so algorithms can be replaced without architectural redesign. The quantum transition is one forced migration; it will not be the last.</li>
        <li><strong>Test migration paths before you need them.</strong> The time to discover that your TLS migration breaks a critical dependency is during a planned exercise  not during an emergency remediation under the 2035 deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserve and document cryptographic knowledge.</strong> Which algorithms are deployed, why, what depends on them, and what the migration path is  this institutional knowledge is a security asset. Losing it is a security risk.</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="philosophy-article reveal">
    <h2>Intellectual Honesty About What the C-BOM Tool Does and Does Not Do</h2>
    <p>Y2Q applies the same intellectual honesty to its own products that it applies to risk assessment:</p>
    <ul class="philosophy-reasons">
        <li><strong>The C-BOM Tool does not solve the quantum threat.</strong> It solves the visibility and inventory problem. What you do with that visibility  the migration engineering, protocol updates, compliance remediation  is additional work the tool supports and prioritises but cannot perform for you.</li>
        <li><strong>The risk scores are structured assessments, not verdicts.</strong> They are based on NIST guidance, documented CVE data, and quantum attack vectors from published research. They are useful starting points for prioritisation. They are not the final word on organisational risk.</li>
        <li><strong>The 2035 deadline is a regulatory floor, not a risk horizon.</strong> For high-risk systems protecting long-lived sensitive data, the C-BOM Tool will correctly flag those systems for earlier migration. The deadline in the tool output reflects data sensitivity and HNDL exposure, not regulatory compliance date.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-quantum algorithms are the best available, not permanently safe.</strong> ML-KEM and ML-DSA are NIST-standardised based on extensive evaluation. They are not proven immune to future cryptanalytic advances. This is why crypto-agility and C-BOM-based monitoring matter beyond the initial migration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This honesty is not a weakness in our product positioning. It is the only approach consistent with the problem we are actually solving.</p>
