            <h2 style="color:var(--text-primary);">How Adversaries Weaponise Zero Trust</h2>
            <p>Zero trust creates friction for attackers  it does not make breach impossible. Sophisticated adversaries have developed systematic techniques to operate within zero trust environments undetected.</p>

                <span class="rc-type critical">Identity Attack</span>
                <h4>Zero Trust's Achilles Heel: The Identity Layer</h4>
                <p>Zero trust gates all access on identity verification. This makes identity the primary attack target. Stolen credentials, session hijacking, and OAuth token theft allow adversaries to authenticate legitimately  receiving verified access indistinguishable from real users. The architecture works exactly as designed  for the wrong person.</p>

            <div class="research-card reveal" data-delay="80">
                <span class="rc-type critical">Quantum Risk</span>
                <h4>Quantum Computing Breaks the Cryptography Beneath Zero Trust</h4>
                <p>Zero trust relies on digital certificates and cryptographic signatures to verify device and service identity. All major zero trust implementations use RSA or ECDSA for certificate signing  both broken by Shor's algorithm. Quantum-enabled attackers can forge device certificates and impersonate legitimate services at the PKI layer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-card reveal" data-delay="160">
                <span class="rc-type warning">Evasion</span>
                <h4>Living Off the Land: Legitimate Tools as Weapons</h4>
                <p>Attackers inside a zero trust environment avoid installing malware. Instead they use tools already present and authorized: PowerShell, WMI, certutil, cloud provider APIs. These actions generate no malware signatures, match the behavioral baseline, and can persist for months. Behavioral analytics fail against an adversary who mirrors legitimate administrative activity.</p>

            <div class="research-card reveal" data-delay="240">
                <span class="rc-type warning">Lateral Movement</span>
                <h4>Micro-Segmentation Is Only As Strong As Its Policies</h4>
                <p>Micro-segmentation limits movement between zones  but depends entirely on accurate, current policy definition. Service-to-service trust policies, overly permissive API scopes, and misconfigured service accounts create pathways adversaries exploit methodically. Policy drift widens these gaps over time without any visible signal.</p>

                <span class="rc-type critical">Supply Chain</span>
                <h4>Trusted Vendor Compromise Bypasses Every Control</h4>
                <p>SolarWinds demonstrated that a trusted software update mechanism delivers attacker code that passes all authentication checks. A legitimately signed but backdoored binary authenticates successfully through every zero trust verification stage. Supply chain compromise introduces a trusted-but-hostile agent that behavioral baselining cannot immediately detect because it IS legitimate.</p>

                <span class="rc-type milestone">Core Principle</span>
                <h4>Assume Breach Means Planning for Failure, Not Preventing It</h4>
                <p>Zero trust's foundational principle is assume breach  not prevent breach. The architecture is designed to limit blast radius, contain lateral movement, and enable rapid detection and response. Organisations that treat zero trust as a prevention mechanism are philosophically misaligned with the framework and will be structurally unprepared for post-breach reality.</p>

    <h2>The Problem: Perimeter Models Have Failed</h2>
    <p>Traditional security assumes a clear boundary: inside the network is trusted, outside is not. Deploy firewalls at the edge. Use VPNs for remote access. Trust internal segments implicitly.</p>
    <p>This model has failed demonstrably and repeatedly. Adversaries breach perimeters. They establish persistent footholds. They move laterally through networks, undetected for months or years.</p>
    <p>Zero Trust inverts the assumption: assume breach. Assume no network segment is inherently safe. Verify every connection. Authenticate every access attempt. Monitor continuously for anomalous behavior.</p>
    <div class="uncertainty-note"><strong>Quantum Dimension:</strong> Zero trust implementations today rely on RSA and ECDSA for certificate-based device authentication throughout the architecture. Shor's algorithm breaks both. This does not invalidate zero trust as an architecture  it means every digital certificate and cryptographic signature in the implementation must migrate to post-quantum algorithms. The architecture survives. The cryptography underneath it must evolve.</div>
</article>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>Zero Trust Architecture Requirements</h2>
    <p>Zero Trust is not a product you can purchase. It is an architectural philosophy that requires:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Identity verification at every layer</strong>  Users, devices, and services authenticated before any access is granted, using certificates that require post-quantum algorithm migration</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous monitoring</strong>  Behavior constantly analyzed; anomalies trigger investigation and response  not just at ingress</li>
        <li><strong>Least privilege access</strong>  Users and services have only the minimum permissions necessary; over-provisioning is a structural attack surface</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-segmentation</strong>  Networks divided into minimal zones based on function and data sensitivity; blast radius of any single breach is contained</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted communication everywhere</strong>  All traffic encrypted, including within "trusted" network zones, using algorithms that must be quantum-safe</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid detection and response capability</strong>  Breaches are expected; systems must detect and contain compromise with minimal dwell time</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>The Adversary Playbook Inside Zero Trust</h2>
    <p>Once inside the perimeter, sophisticated attackers navigate zero trust controls with systematic precision. They must accomplish several objectives while remaining invisible:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Bypass authentication with valid credentials</strong>  Steal credentials, exploit MFA weaknesses, compromise identity providers to obtain legitimate tokens</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain behavioral camouflage</strong>  Mimic legitimate user behavior; stay below anomaly detection thresholds; pace operations to avoid triggering alerts</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege escalation via legitimate paths</strong>  Move from limited access to elevated access through service accounts, overly permissive policies, and trusted application channels</li>
        <li><strong>Establish redundant persistence before any aggressive action</strong>  Multiple backdoors, implants, and access paths staged before any payload execution or data exfiltration</li>
        <li><strong>Exploit inter-service trust for lateral movement</strong>  Use approved service-to-service API calls to reach deeper network segments without policy violations</li>
        <li><strong>Live off the land exclusively</strong>  No custom malware; only authorized tools; no signatures that could alert endpoint detection systems</li>
    </ul>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>The Limits of Zero Trust</h2>
    <p>Zero trust is powerful but not a complete solution. Its limitations must be part of any honest threat model:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li><strong>Implementation complexity</strong>  Zero trust architectures are difficult to implement correctly; policy errors and configuration drift are common and create exploitable gaps</li>
        <li><strong>Identity as a single point of failure</strong>  If the identity provider is compromised, the entire architecture's verification layer is compromised with it</li>
        <li><strong>Insider threats bypass intent verification</strong>  An insider with legitimate access and legitimate intent to harm passes every authentication check successfully</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptographic expiration</strong>  The PKI and certificate infrastructure underlying device and service identity will require complete migration as quantum capabilities scale</li>
        <li><strong>Detection gaps are real</strong>  No behavioral monitoring system is perfect; sophisticated attackers calibrate their actions to stay within detection thresholds indefinitely</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="research-article reveal">
    <h2>Zero Trust and Survivability</h2>
    <p>Zero Trust is not about preventing breach. It is about assuming breach and designing systems to survive it. The architecture succeeds when it:</p>
    <ul class="research-list">
        <li>Limits attacker movement through least privilege and micro-segmentation even after credential compromise</li>
        <li>Makes lateral movement slow, expensive, and detectable  not impossible</li>
        <li>Enables rapid detection through continuous monitoring focused on behavior rather than perimeter</li>
        <li>Allows quick containment when compromise is confirmed  isolating affected segments without full system shutdown</li>
        <li>Preserves critical system functions even when adjacent segments are actively compromised</li>
        <li>Maintains crypto-agile PKI infrastructure capable of algorithm migration when the quantum horizon arrives</li>
